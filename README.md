# Project Fresh Fish

## About: 

App-project in the subject INFO212
Information Science, University of Bergen

We wanted to make an application that allows the user to locate waters 
for freshwater-fishing and get information like type of fish present,
type of bait to recommend, where to locate the waters, how the water quality is
and other information. We wanted to wrap all this information in a package which
was lite, easy to navigate and made for a good user experience.

## Tools used:

- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation
- React Native Firebase
- React Native Collapsible and Collapsible-List
- React Native Maps
- Visual Studio, Photoshop
